# Electricity Consumption Forecasting using SARIMA

This project predicts monthly household electricity consumption using SARIMA-based time series forecasting. Real consumption data from September 2023 to January 2024 was analyzed and used to forecast February usage. The project also evaluates model performance using error percentage trends.

##  Project Features
- Time Series Forecasting with SARIMA
- Visual consumption trend graph
- Forecasted next-month consumption
- Error (%) reduction graph across datasets
- Clean visualization using Matplotlib

##  Tech Stack
| Library | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Pandas | Data cleaning & preprocessing |
| Matplotlib | Visualizing consumption and error graph |
| Statsmodels SARIMAX | Time-series forecasting |

## Submitted for Electrical Engineering mini-project

- Score: 18 on 20, A+.
